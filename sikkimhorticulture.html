<th><h1>CEREALS:- Rice, Maize</h1><hr color="blue" width="150"></th></tr>
<tr><td rowspan="2"><p>	Rice is one among the oldest cultivated crop as evident from Vedic literatures and Archeological excavation. It is being cultivated in India and China since thousands of years. About 90 % of world’s area under rice is in Asia and about 90 % of world’s rice is produced and consumed in Asia. Globally rice is grown in more than 150m ha area. India and Chine together hold about half the world’s rice area and more than 60 % people are rice eaters. Rice is the main staple food and the first cultivated crop in Asia long before the era of which we have the historical evidences (Parthasarathi, 1960 and Ghosh et al., 1960). No one really knows exactly where first seeds of rice originated.

Cultivation of rice in Tropical Asia probably began about 10,000 years ago (De Datta, 1981). In India, oldest specimen of rice was found in Hasthinapur (UP) in a carbonized form during excavation (1000-750 BC). India may have had the earliest date of cultivation as wild rice is found in abundant. Domestication process first took place in China and later transmitted to South East Asia. It is also believed that wild rice first cultivated in Bangladesh, Assam, Orissa or its surrounding areas. It is also cultivated in most countries of west and North Africa (Egypt), east and central Africa. Its cultivation further extended to south and Central American countries (Latin America), Australia, USA and Southern European countries like Spain, Italy, and France.

Rice is one among the staple food crop in Sikkim as inferred from the epithet “Denzong”-meaning “Valley of Rice”. Its antiquity is Sikkim is difficult to trace out but some experts consider the entire NE Region including Sikkim and adjoining area of China shall be the probable home of rice. A large number of landraces are cultivated in Sikkim in addition to introduced since 1970s.
Rice is one of the most important cereal crops of Sikkim grown in all places having warm and humid climate with shallow water. It is cultivated over an area of about 14.15 thousand hectare. The production of rice was 22.69 thousand tones in 2005- 06 and 21.45 thousand tones in 2006-07. This yield could be increased by and effective implementation of special food grain production programme (SFPP) and special rice development programme (SRPP).
<br><br>
Maize is ranked second to wheat among the world cereal crops (FAO 1986). Some 70 countries produce maize 1,00,000 hectares or more, 53 from the developing nations. Developed market economies account for 30% of the global maize area, but provide 50% of the total production as their average yields is three times higher than the world average. Developing nations accounted for 60% of the world total maize area, but produce only 40% of the global harvest (Timothy et al., 1988). In 1996, the total area under maize production was 141,116,000 ha with a total yield of 590,091,000 metric tons of which 266,214,000 tons were harvested for grain.

The distribution over the continents reflects the relative importance attached to maize in the different regions. North America with 41,064,000 ha produced over 50% of the world’s production in 1998. It had a mean yield of 6.48 tons/ha. South America had 19,612,000 ha under maize (2.88 tons/ha), Europe had 13,251,000 ha (4.783 tons/ha), Africa 24,879,000 ha (1.63 tons/ha), Asia 42,203,000 ha (3.82 tons/ha) and Oceania with 83,000 ha (6.22 tons/ha) (USDA 1998). According to the USDA-ARS, the 9 billion bushels per year of maize produced in the US are valued at 30 billion dollars. Maize is also the chief export crop of the US. The maize exported exceeds all the maize used domestically for food, seed, and industrial purposes. Over half of maize used domestically is used as livestock feed (USDA, 1999).

Sixty four percent of the maize produced in the world and 72% in the developed markets is used as animal feed. Less developed countries use 48% of their grain maize for animal feed and Eastern Europe and former USSR use 79% of their maize for animal feed. Maize used directly for human consumption accounts for only 21% of the world maize production. Developed markets, less developed countries and Eastern Europe and former USSR use 14, 40and 4% of the maize produced directly as human food (CIMMYT 1993/94).

United States is the largest producer of maize in the world. In 1997, US planted 80,227,000 acres to maize. Of those, 78,720,000 acres were harvested for grain while the remaining 5,758,000 acres were used for silage. The leading state with highest acreage of maize was Iowa (12 million acres) and the lowest was Montana with 14,000 acres. The average national production was 127 bushels/acre. The production varied a lot across states with some states producing as much as 195 bushels/acre (Oregon) and as low as 123 bushels/acre (Indiana) (Corn refiners association 1998).

<tr><td><p>Mandarin orange is the most common among citrus fruits grown in India. It occupies nearly 50% of the total citrus area in India. Mandarin group includes all types of loose jacket oranges commonly called Santra or mandarin such as Nagpur Santra, Coorg Santra, the Khasi Mandarin, Sikkim Mandarin etc. Sikkim Mandarin represents the most important commercial fruit of Sikkim. Sikkim Mandarin is similar to the Nepal or Assam or Darjeeling Mandarin. Citrus reticulate is a highly polyembryonic species, having medium sized upright trees. Besides world wide demand of Mandarin Oranges as fresh fruits, these can be used for the preparation of a number of processed products like orange marmalade, bottled and canned juices, squash, jam, jelly etc. Orange oil is also important citrus oil used for flavouring purposes.
The origin of citrus reticulate is China. Though, it is grown in many states of India, certain belts/pockets have emerged as the leading producers. The valleys of Tista and Rangeet rivers and their tributaries of Sikkim and adjoining Darjeeling district of West Bengal offer an ideal Himalayan climate for the cultivation of Sikkim Mandarin. Other Mandarin oranges are grown in the regions of Coorg (Karnataka) the Wynad tracts of Malabar (Kerala), Nilgiris, Shevroy Hills and Yerc and Hills (Tamil Nadu). Khasi Mandarin is extensively grown in Khasi, Jaintia and Lushia Hills and the districts of Cachar, Kamrup, Goalpara, Darrange and Sibsagar. The famous Nagpur Santra is grown around Nagpur region of Central India. In Punjab, mandarin cultivation is confined to the sub-mountain districts of gurdaspur, Hosiarpur and Kangra. In Uttarakhand, the main Santra growing areas are sub-mountain tracts of Garhwal in the kumaon hills. Mandarins are also grown around Saharanpur, Banaras, Mirzapur districts and humid plains of Bengal and Bihar having varying altitudes and rainfall.

In Sikkim, mandarin is cultivated in an area of about 6,300 hectares, with a total average annual production of about 17,190 tonnes. The important orange producing areas are the Tista and Rangeet river valleys within the elevation range of 600 to 1500 m above mean sea level. Tashiding, Gyalshing, Omchung, Tijyah, Lingchom, Bermiok, Barthang, Rinchenpong, Chinthang, Chakung, Zoom, Timberbong, Karthok in the West; Kewzing, Lingmoo, Sangmoo, Yangang, Payong, Rateypani, Namthang, Tarku, Tokal- Bermiok, Turuk, Sumbuk in the South; Nazitam, Sang, Simiklingy, Khamdong, Sirwani, Samdong in the East and Dikchu and Hee-Gyathang in the North district of Sikkim are the important orange growing areas of Sikkim.
<br><br>
Banana is one of the oldest tropical fruits cultivated by man from prehistoric time in India with great socio-economic significance, interwoven in the cultural heritage of the country. It is also fourth important food crop in terms of gross value after paddy, wheat and milk products and forms an important crop for subsistence farmers. It is also desert fruit for millions apart from a staple food owing to its rich and easily digestible carbohydrates with a calorific value of 67 to 137/100 gm fruit. It is the most important fruits of India.

Bananas and plantains have apparent ambiguity of using the words. Usually banana is used as desert fruit. Plantains are generally much starchier and generally used for culinary purpose. Plantain and cooking bananas are staple food of people of many countries of Central and West Africa, the Carribean Islands and Latin America.

In Sikkim it is fourth most important fruit and cultivated (hill banana) throughout the state in the kitchen garden, boundaries of field and farms etc. since 1976 onwards the cultivation of banana in orchard was started with introduction of high yielding variety such as Dwarf Cavendish from Bihar, Bengal and other states of India.

<tr><td rowspan="2"><p>Chili is an important cash crop in India and is grown for its pungent fruits, which are used both green and ripe (the latter in the dried form) to impart pungency to the food. Green chillies are rich in Vitamin A and C, minerals and protein. Dry chillies are also rich in Vitamin A and D. As a condiment, it has become indispensable in every Indian home. It is also used medicinally, sauces, chutneys and pickles. Nadkarni (1927) has reported many medicinal value of chilli. Its paste is externally used as rubefacient and as local stimulant for the tonsils in tonsillitis. It is irritant internally and produces gastroenteritis. It is used with many ingredients for local remedies. In West Indies it is used to relieve the sinking at the epigastrium felt by drunkards. The pungency is due to the oleoresin ‘capsicin’ (a volatile alkaloid and its acridity is due to capsicin) contained in the skin and the septa of the fruit. Chilli was known to Indians about 400 years ago, when this crop was first introduced into India by Portuguese, towards the end of the 15th century. Its cultivation became popular in the 17th century. It is now grown in all parts of India covering about 7,33,800 hectares. Chilli is valued for its diverse commercial uses. Only a few perennial chilli varieties characterized by small-sized pods upright fruiting and high pungency are rarely cultivated commercially belong to C. frutescens.

The largest producer of chillies in the world is India accounting for 11 lakh tons of production annually followed by China with a production of around 4 lakh tons. Mexico and Pakistan produces 3 lakhs tonnes each of chili every year. India also leads in the context of maximum area covered under chilli cultivation. In Sikkim, cherry pepper also known as dale khorsani is the most favorite chili grown in almost every kitchen garden.

Capsicum (chillies) constitutes the most important spice grown all over the world except in colder parts. There are many varieties differing in habit, size, shape, color and pungency of fruit. Among these paprika’s with mild pungency cultivated mainly in European countries, viz. Hungary, Spain, Bulgaria, Rumania and Poland. Chilies with higher pungency grown in tropical countries , viz. India, China, Pakistan, Nigeria, Malaysia, Japan and Turkey are Important. Total world chilli production in green form is 7 to 8 million tones (2 to 3 million tones in dry form).

<tr><td><p>Tomato is one of the most important – “protective foods” because of its special nutritive value and widespread production. It is the world’s third largest vegetable crop after potato and sweet potato, but it tops the list of capped vegetables. Tomatoes are used for soup, salad, pickles, ketchup, puree, sauces etc. It was introduced in India by the Portuguese. It is now the most important and remunerative vegetable in India. Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Bihar, Orissa are the major tomato growing states. Because of suitable agro climatic conditions of Sikkim, tomato can be grown throughout year.

The name ‘broccoli’ refers to the young shoots which develop in spring on same species of the genus Brassica (‘brocco’ is Italian for a shoot). In Italy, these have been used as vegetable from early times but their economic importance become appreciable only since the thirties of the century when this vegetable became popular in the U.S.A.

Sprouting broccoli is sometimes briefly called broccoli, through this name is also used for broccoli rape and for winter cauliflower (winter broccoli or heading broccoli). In India, its cultivation is negligible and limited to kitchen garden but now it is becoming increasingly popular in hotels in Mumbai, Kolkata, Delhi and Chennai. It is mostly cultivated in the hilly region of Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Nilgiri hills and northern plains of India. Sikkim has the suitable weather for its cultivation and, therefore, there is a tremendous scope for its cultivation and supply of broccoli to different parts of the country and even export too.

Morphologically, sprouting broccoli resembles cauliflower. The plant forms a kind of head, consisting of green buds and thick fleshy flower stalks. The terminal head is rather loose, green in color and the flower stalks are larger than cauliflower. The sprouts in the axils of leaves develop strongly, especially after the removal of the terminal head. Both terminal and sprouts with bud clusters are consumed as human food.

Chayote (Sechium edule) is a member of the family Cucurbitaceous vegetable. The name chayote is derived from the vine’s Indian name, Chacha. It is a popular vegetable in N-E hilly region commonly called squash and grows abundantly without much care and attention in high hills of Meghalaya, Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland and Sikkim. Chayote is a perennial rooted cucurbit, with climbing vines and leaves resembling those of the cucumber. Its vine can grow as high as 12 meters. Its leaves are heart-shape, 10-25 cm wide and with tendrils on the stem. The flowers are cream-colored or somewhat green that comes out beneath a leaf or branch. It is a monoecious plant but male and female flowers borne in separate places. If the vine is male, the flowers are in cluster; if female, the flowers are slitary. The light green, pear shaped fruit, with deep ridges lengthwise, may weigh as much as one kilogram, but most often is from 170-340 grams. The chayote fruit differs from its multi-seeded relatives, in that it contains only a single, flat edible seed. Fruits may be slightly grooved, and its skin may be prickly or smooth.
<br><br>
Cauliflower was introduced in India in 1822 (Swarup and Chatterjee, 1972). The initial introduction was the Cornish types Bram England and later the other European types also were introduced. The typical Indian cauliflowers were the result of intercrossing between the Cornish and other European types. Thus a new development took place in India resulting in tropical cauliflower resistant to hot weather and high rainfall. These types are normally grown in Indian plains from May-June to January which is followed by the only temperate cauliflower known as snowball. All these cauliflowers grown in India are annual, both Indian and snowballs. Among the winter vegetables in India, cauliflower is possibly the most popular. It is an important vegetable crops of the Sikkim and is widely cultivated for its white tender head (curd). It is a nutritious vegetable and contains a good amount of Vitamin B and a fair amount of protein, minerals and vitamins A and C.
