<h2>Schemes of Assam</h2>
<br>

<p>
<h3>1. Preamble :</h3><br>
1.1 Tourism has emerged as one of the largest industries in the World today. It is an industry which
can easily change the economic scenario of a country. Several countries have transformed
themselves through tourism and created a global presence in the tourism industry. Tourism
is not directed to commercial or population centers but in most cases towards natural and
cultural resources. Thus, tourism can contribute significantly where other commercial
activities are limited. Developed tourism can bring smiles to every household of a state or
a country. Tourist movements have spread across the globe, becoming for many of them an
important sector in terms of employment generation and foreign exchange earnings.
1.2 As reported by the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) Tourism Highlights
2015 Edition, International tourist arrivals grew to 1.1 billion in 2014 from a mere 25 million in
1950. The UNWTO estimate that approximately 1 in every 11 person in the World is employed
by the tourism industry. As of 2014, the global tourism industry generated USD 7.6 trillion,
constituting 10% of the global GDP.
1.3 The economic significance of tourism especially in terms of employment, income generation,
foreign exchange and regional development is a major driving force that enables the national
and state governments to place tourism most appropriately, in the overall development agenda.
The Union Government has recently declared that it would give top priority on the development
of five ‘T’s i.e. Tradition, Talent, Trade, Technology and Tourism for overall development of
the nation. Local communities across the tourism destinations are encouraged to minimize
leakages and maximize linkages of the industry with a view to reap maximum benefit.
1.4 Assam is endowed with plentiful natural and cultural resources which can form the basis for
a very lucrative tourism industry, creating employment and generating income not only in
the urban centers but also in the rural areas. What has held tourism back in Assam was its
insurgency issues, its remoteness, a sense of perceived insecurity and negative publicity of
the place. The need of the hour is to market Assam vigorously in order to refurbish its image
in the national and international market using latest technological interventions. Assam can
become one of the most sought after destinations in the country because of its magnificent
tourism products like exotic wildlife, awesome scenic beauty, colorful fairs and festivals, age
old historical monuments, lush green tea gardens and golf courses, massive river Brahmaputra
and its tributaries, serene and tranquil country side and warm and hospitable people.
1.5 Tourism activities in Assam have developed sporadically and in an unplanned manner. Also
due to very limited government funds made available to the tourism sector and hesitation of
the private sector to invest due to various issues, tourism promotion and marketing activities
have always taken a back seat. <br><br>


<h3>2.Vision</h3><br>
2.1 Assam becomes a Nationally and Internationally acclaimed all-season Tourist destination for
its unique wildlife, bio-diversity and experience of an unexploited wonderland. Tourism is to

<h3>5. Strategies:</h3><br>
5.1 Assam Tourism website.
5.1.1 An interactive and fully comprehensive website of Assam Tourism will be launched wherein all
required information for any prospective domestic or international tourist will be readily available
at the click of the mouse. The website will contain linkages to all sorts of information and bookings
including Hotels, Air Travel, Rail & Road, Bus, Home Stays, Bed & Breakfast accommodation,
Restaurants, Details of Tourist destinations, packages, Fairs and events, Route maps etc. It will have
the facility for two way interactions with all stakeholders such as Tourists, Tour Guides and Tour
operators. Hoteliers, Restaurateurs etc to collect feedback information on Do’s and Don’ts, weather
and local cultures will also be hosted to guide the prospective tourists.
5.1.2 A vigorous campaigning through social media such as Facebook, You-Tube, Twitter, Blogging
sites will be launched to attract the younger up-coming generation of Tourists. A special cell for
maintenance & updating of information will be created for sustainability. A separate statistical
cell shall also be created for Management Information System, generation of statistics and their
analysis.
5.1.3 Regular Meet with the National and International Tour Operators Association & Hoteliers &
Restaurateurs Association will be organized. Fam tours will also be organized regularly.

5.2 Building Brand
5.2.1 Inspite of having tremendous tourism potential, Assam has not yet aggressively marketed itself. A
comprehensive marketing strategy will be chalked out in consultation with professional agencies.
A brand image of Assam as “Awesome Assam” will be created portraying the states uniqueness and
exotic beauty. The brand name will be translated to Hindi and other National and International
languages.
5.2.2 A renowned celebrity will be roped in as brand Ambassador of Awesome Assam.
5.2.3 A blitz-Krieg National & International Promotional Campaign shall be launched to build “Awesome
Assam brand through newspapers life style magazines, in-flight magazines, TV advertisements,
Talk shows, Road shows, Travel marts and Tourism stalls and kiosks etc.
5.3 Assam-A Tourist hub for North East India.
5.3.1 Assam is the gateway to the North Eastern states. Geographically and culturally the states have
interdependent relationship. A total NE perspective in tourism planning, where the strength of
each state complement each other is beneficial to all and is a constructive way forward for tourism
promotion. Assam will play a proactive role to develop such a wide view of tourism promotion
through coordination among the states in creating zonal and regional circuits.
5.3.2 Most of the tourists travelling to other seven sister states have to transit through Guwahati. Half/
full day City tour packages by ATDC and private operators will be an incentive for the travellers to
extend their duration of stay which in turn will boost the local economy.
5.4 Wildlife Tourism
5.4.1 An attractive feature of the Assam’s forests is its colorful wildlife. Some of the species are exclusive
to the state. Assam is famous as the home of one-horned rhinoceros which is its unique selling
point apart from the fauna.
5.4.2 Though most of the domestic and international tourists are drawn towards Kaziranga and this
heritage site has got best tourist facilities with private participation, yet the Government will
develop infrastructure around individual Wildlife sanctuaries such as Manas, Pabitora, Orang,
Pani Dihing, Barail and Nameri at Dibru-Saikhowa across Assam to accommodate tourists and
resort to aggressive marketing to position Assam as Wildlife destination of the world. The Quality
of Tourist facilities will be improved and proper tourist information centers will be established in
each place.
5.5 Spiritual Tourism
5.5.1 After wildlife, it is the spiritual tourism which attracts pilgrim tourists to Assam. Centering on the
most famous Shakti-peeth, Kamakhya Temple atop Nilachal hill top in Guwahati city, the religious/
spiritual tourism can catapult Assam into a major spiritual tourism destination in the country.
Assam is known among the pilgrims and domestic tourists as a wonderland soaked in Shaktipooja, mysticism, tantric practice, mythology and black magic of Mayong with Kamakhya as the
epicenter. This advantage shall be turned into revenue spinning machine and local employment
creation by right interventions.
Iconic temples and other religious monuments sprawl
across the state, some of which date back to medieval
times and reflect the great historical and cultural past.

5.5.2 Kamakhya Temple perched on top of picturesque Nilachal Hill in the middle of city is surrounded by
numerous minor temples dotting the hill. Its unique position in Indian mythology and convenient
geographical location attracts thousands of pilgrim tourists to the Nilachal Hill. Therefore a brand
Nilachal will be developed in the next five years in an integrated manner utilizing Government
of India funds under PRASAD scheme. The Government will endeavour to help put in place best
practices for the Management of the Temple.
5.5.3 An annual four day Ambubasi Mela at Kamakhya temple during the month of June has come to
be known as Mahakumbh of the East where lakhs of people and sadhus congregate. This shall
be highlighted in publicity campaigns in domestic tourist circuits with an appropriate tagline
giving forceful punch to spiritual tourism.
5.5.4 Hajo is another centre where people from three religions- Hindu, Muslim and Buddhists
converge for pilgrimage. It has always been symbol of communal harmony for the country
and will continue to be projected as such. Hajo will also be linked with Guwahati city tour/ day
tour.
5.5.5 “Sankardev Trail” or “Vaishnav- Trail”- projecting Vaishnavite cultural proliferation in Assam
will be developed in Barpeta-Bordua-Majuli. A number of Museums depicting the life of the
great saint & reformer and development of neo-vaishnavism will be set up with the help of
the Government. A number of local souvenirs, local handicrafts and cuisines will be developed
and managed by the Local entrepreneurs.
5.5.7 Eff orts shall be directed for preparing Buddhist circuit in the State to woo large number of
Buddhist pilgrims.
5.6 Ethnic Tourism
5.6.1 Assam has been a unique place on earth for the cultural and ethnic diversities. The state is
a home land of various ethnic tribes and groups, each having its own cultural heritage. Each
of these tribes possesses some unique features in its socio-cultural life including customs,
religious belief, language, culture, dress, way of life, festivals, food habits, songs and dances
which are diff erent from others.
5.6.2 Ethnic Tourist circuits will be developed to attract the tourists from all over the world. The
ethnic socio-cultural and religious festivals will be organized where Songs and dances, display
of colourful dresses, tasting of innumerable varieties of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian
dishes is the main feature.
5.6.3 Foreign tourists in India are driven by the desire to see something diff erent where curiosity
is the ultimate factor. The travelers choose to experience firsthand practices of another
culture, and may involve performances, presentations and attractions portraying or
presented by indigenous communities. In a broader perspective, it includes cultural, heritage,
anthropological, tribal, village and similar forms of tourism. Ethnic tourism, will be properly
planned, managed and promoted as sustainable form of tourism and also utilized as a tool for
the preservation and conservation of culture and heritage as well as for poverty alleviation.

5.7 Tea & Golf Tourism.
5.7.1. Since discovery of tea in 1823, tea-gardens have become an integral part of Assam’s landscape.
Each of these thousands of lush green tea gardens in Assam is a treasure house of exotic beauty
of nature with colourful people and their enchanting songs and dances, sprawling bungalows,
and residential facilities. Many of these tea gardens have polo fields and golf courses. There
are as many as thirty air strips and helipads maintained by the tea garden management. These
facilities can be included within attractive Tourist packages.
5.7.2 Therefore, coordination with the management of the tea gardens can eff ectively do a lot in
promoting tea tourism in the state. Tourism Department will engage and persuade some of
the willing tea gardens to be a partner in tea tourism packages.
5.7.3 There are about 20 key golf courses located mostly within the compact arear of tea gardens.
These off er a unique opportunity to develop golf tourism in the state. Most of the courses are
located near the airstrips and helipads maintained by the tea garden management. In recent
years, domestic and foreign tourists are coming to play golf in diff erent golf courses, and a
good number of them use these air strips and helipads.
5.7.4 Golf tourism will also be integrated with eco and tea tourism.
5.8 River Tourism
5.8.1 The State of Assam has an extensive river network. Brahmaputra is intrinsic to the socio-cultural
life in Assam. Assam has immense opportunities to develop river tourism and water leisure
activities. Colorful canal barges, boating, luxury cruisers, motor boats, dolphin shows, under
water-world, water sports and lighters, para sailing, river rafting, water amusements and
more. River tourism in Assam could be a great way to spend holidays. International standard
of luxury cruises can be a great driver to draw more domestic and international tourist traffic
to Assam.
5.8.2 Ethnic tourism on both banks of river with infrastructure and on-shore linkages for night halts
from Guwahati to Majuli will be put in place by promoting ethnic tourism.
5.8.3 Recently the endangered Gangetic river Dolphin has been voted the “City Animal” of Guwahati
and it can be spotted in large numbers in the Kulsi at Kukurmara. In the vicinity of Kulsi, Mirza
and Bijoynagar are famous for rural household weaving and of use natural dyes, while the
Industrial Complex at Chatabari houses, a unit which prepares tree free handmade paper and
paper handicrafts from elephant dung and local plant wastes. This can be developed as river
cum ethnic tourist circuit.
5.8.4 Government will promote river taxi services between the North and South banks at
Brahmaputra at places of touristic interest.

5.9 Transit Tourism
5.9.1 For many of the tourists, particularly for foreigners, Guwahati is not only a tourist destination
but also is perceived as a halt or the entry-point to the north eastern states. It is a city from
where one could connect to other parts of Assam or get in and out of the northeast. On an
average, a tourist spends about 2 days in transit which could be turned as a great opportunity
to promote Guwahati City based Tourism titled as ‘One day in Guwahati’ or ‘Two days in
Guwahati’.
5.9.2 Apart from Tourist spot visits in the day time, Government will also promote Night Life in
and around Guwahati city like nightclubs, malls, pubs, bars, sports bar and indoor gaming etc
through the Private Sector.
5.10 Adventure Tourism
5.10.1 The enchanting blue hills and speedy rivers of Assam provide and enormous scope for the
development of water based adventure tourism. Recently, some of the adventure sports
activities like rock-climbing, trekking, para-sailing, water sports, river rafting and angling are
promoted by the Department of Tourism. Tourism Department will join hands with Adventure
Institute of Sports Department to design various adventure activities at tourist sites catering to
tourists in particular. This will generate a lot of employment opportunities for local youths.
5.11 Monsoon & Leisure Tourism
5.11.1 Assam has early onset of Monsoon, generally beginning from 15th of May, compared to most
other parts of India where Monsoon arrives only in late June or early July. Maximum day
temperatures remain around a comfortable 27-34 degrees centigrade with plenty of rain
when the large part of western India simmers under successive heat waves with temperatures
soaring as high as 38-45 degrees. The comparatively cooler climate and fulsome rains coupled
with summer vacations in other parts of the country is a major advantage for Assam to attract
domestic travellers. ‘The Monsoon Country’ tag and proximity to Cherrapunjee, the wettest
place on earth and discounts in luxury hotels, cottages, homestays and huts-on-stilts will
obliterate seasonality in Assam Tourism and generate revenue throughout the year.
