The state is home to several types of silks, the most prominent and prestigious being muga, the golden silk exclusive to this state. Muga apart, there is paat, and eri, the latter being used in the manufacture of warm clothes.
Of a naturally rich golden colour, muga is the finest of India's wild silks. It is produced only in Assam. The women of Assam weave fairy tales in their looms. In earlier times, the skill to weave was the primary qualification of a young girl for her eligibility for marriage. This perhaps explains why Assam has the largest concentration of handlooms and weavers in India. One of the world's finest artistic traditions finds expression in their exquisitely woven 'Eri', 'Muga' and 'Pat' fabrics.

The traditional handloom silks still hold their own in world markets They score over factory-made silks in the richness of their textures and designs, in their individuality, character and classic beauty. No two handwoven silks are exactly alike. Personality of the weaver, her hereditary skill, her innate sense of colour and balance all help to create a unique product.

Today, India exports a wide variety of silks to western Europe and the United States, especially as exclusive furnishing fabrics. Boutiques and fashion houses, designers and interior decorators have the advantage of getting custom-woven fabrics in the designs, weaves and colours of their choice. A service that ensures an exclusive product not easily copied by competitors.

<td><center><p>The Directorate of Handicrafts and Handloom (D.H.H) began its history in the year 1957 when it was established as a Technical Institute for Training and Production of traditional arts and crafts with 58 nos. of trainees. Over the years, this Institute has evolved into a major centre of learning and training in the Traditional Arts and Crafts of the State. The Directorate of Handicrafts and Handloom as on date is a hub of activity, development and progress showcasing the traditional arts and crafts of Sikkim. The growth and expansion of D.H.H in terms of physical assets, infrastructure and manpower has been impressive, having on date as many as 32 branch training centers throughout the State with a total no. of 388 trainees.

The Directorate's primary objective is not only to preserve and showcase the traditional arts and crafts of Sikkim but to promote and disseminate information regarding the policy orientation of the government in setting the highest standard comparable to the best in the world for arts and crafts, skill development and environment friendly working culture. As a policy initiative there has been tremendous investment in Skill Development Programmes whereby local trainees and artisans are trained in multiple crafts with the objective of developing and acquiring skills which will enable them not only to generate employment but in the long run to acquire self sufficiency and self reliance. The need of the hour is to harness the potential of this extremely vast resource of educated and extremely mobile youth force and channelize them into a productive socio-economic entity that is inherently strong and provides a solid base line for further growth. The challenges for ensuring integration of the various growth factors as also creating a competent civil system in Sikkim. is formidable but nonetheless with the support of the government and implementation of the various initiatives in the right perspective these challenges can be overcome.</p>
